# GitHub Migration & Setup — Docs Index

Use this index to navigate the focused guides. All links are relative and the docs cross-link to each other and the end-to-end migration guide.

> Note: Only production deployments are supported. Releases are prepared on `release/vX.Y.Z` and promoted to production from the release branch. The GitHub Environment is named `production`; the production branch is `uat3`. See: [Workflows Guide](./github-workflows/README.md), [Repo: Environments & Branch Protections](./github-repo-setup-environments.md), [Post‑Migration Setup](./github-post-migration-setup.md).
